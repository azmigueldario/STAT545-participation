## Create a Git controlled project

Just link to a repo in Github while creating new project.
A new tab named Git will be associated with this project


**_Pull_** brings data from the remote version (online)

**_Commit_** lets you save changes before trying to merge in remote location

**_Push_** is the intent to merge your local data with remote data

**_Branch button_** lets you work in a local branch before pushing to merge


### Disaster recovery

- Commit often
- Push often
- Github remote is your worst case scenario */ Plan B

In case all goes wrong:\
\
1. Save all files in a safe place different from local repo
1. Rename local repo
1. Clone github repo again
1. Copy all additional files back, try to commit and push
