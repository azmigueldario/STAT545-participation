## Motivating the need for factors in R

Factors are how we store categorical variables in `R`.\
\
The values a factor can take are called **levels** and are showed as strings ("Colombia", "Venezuela") altough each *level* is really assigned a number: 1,2,3,etc.

- Check your variables when something weard happens, use `class()`
- Base read.csv(), read.table() and data.frame() change *strings* to *factors* by default

### Forcats package

Special package to handle factor related operations

```r
str(gapminder$continent)
```

```
##  Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
```

```r
levels(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## [1] "Africa"   "Americas" "Asia"     "Europe"   "Oceania"
```

```r
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

```r
class(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```


```r
fct_count(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 2
##   f            n
##   <fct>    <int>
## 1 Africa     624
## 2 Americas   300
## 3 Asia       396
## 4 Europe     360
## 5 Oceania     24
```



### Activity 1: Using Factors for plotting 

**1.1** Let's look again into `gapminder` dataset and create a new cloumn, `life_level`, that contains five categories ("very high", "high","moderate", "low" and "very low") based on life expectancy in 1997. Assign categories accoring to the table below:

| Criteria | life_level| 
|-------------|-----------|
| less than 23 | very low |
| between 23 and 48 | low |
| between 48 and 59 | moderate |
| between 59 and 70 | high |
| more than 70 | very high |

Function `case_when()` is a tidier way to vectorise multiple `if_else()` statements. you can read more about this function [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html).


```r
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == FILL_IN_THIS) %>% 
  mutate(life_level = case_when(lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                TRUE ~ FILL_IN_THIS)) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(x = FILL_IN_THIS, y = FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  labs(y = "GDP per capita, $", x= "Life expectancy level, years") +
  theme_bw() 
```

```
## Error: object 'FILL_IN_THIS' not found
```

Do you notice anything odd/wrong about the graph?

We can make a few observations:

- It seems that none of the countries had a "very low" life-expectancy in 1997. 

- However, since it was an option in our analysis it should be included in our plot. Right?

- Notice also how levels on x-axis are placed in the "wrong" order.

**1.2** You can correct these issues by explicitly setting the levels parameter in the call to `factor()`. Use, `drop = FALSE` to tell the plot not to drop unused levels 

```r
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == FILL_IN_THIS) %>% 
  mutate(life_level = case_when(lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                lifeExp < FILL_IN_THIS ~ FILL_IN_THIS,
                                TRUE ~ FILL_IN_THIS) ,
                      levels = FILL_IN_THIS)) %>% %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_boxplot(aes(x = FILL_IN_THIS, y = FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  labs(y = "GDP per capita, $", x= "Life expectancy level, years") +
  theme_bw() 
```

```
## Error: <text>:8:45: unexpected ')'
## 7:                                 TRUE ~ FILL_IN_THIS) ,
## 8:                       levels = FILL_IN_THIS))
##                                                ^
```

## Inspecting factors (activity 2)

In Activity 1, we created our own factors, so now let's explore what categorical variables that we have in the `gapminder` dataset.

### Exploring `gapminder$continent` (activity 2.1)

Use functions such as `str()`, `levels()`, `nlevels()` and `class()` to answer the following questions:

- what class is  `continent`(a factor or charecter)?
- How many levels? What are they?
- What integer is used to represent factor "Asia"?



### Exploring `gapminder$country` (activity 2.2)

Let's explore what else we can do with factors:

Answer the following questions: 

- How many levels are there in `country`?
- Filter `gapminder` dataset by 5 countries of your choice. How many levels are in your filtered dataset?



## Dropping unused levels

What if we want to get rid of some levels that are "unused" - how do we do that? 

The function `droplevels()` operates on all the factors in a data frame or on a single factor. The function `forcats::fct_drop()` operates on a factor.


```r
h_gap_dropped <- FILL_IN_THIS %>% 
  droplevels()
```

```
## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'FILL_IN_THIS' not found
```

## Changing the order of levels

Let's say we wanted to re-order the levels of a factor using a new metric - say, count().

We should first produce a frequency table as a tibble using `dplyr::count()`:



The table is nice, but it would be better to visualize the data.
Factors are most useful/helpful when plotting data.
So let's first plot this:


```r
FILL_IN_THIS %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Number of entries") + xlab("Continent")
```

```
## Error in eval(lhs, parent, parent): object 'FILL_IN_THIS' not found
```

Think about how levels are normally ordered. 
It turns out that by default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. 
However, it is preferable to order the levels according to some principle:

  1. Frequency/count. 
  
- Make the most common level the first and so on. Function `fct_infreq()` might be useful.
- The function `fct_rev()` will sort them in the opposite order.

For instance ,
    `  

```r
gapminder %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Number of entries") + xlab("Continent")
```

```
## Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): object 'FILL_IN_THIS' not found
```

Section 9.6 of Jenny Bryan's [notes](https://stat545.com/factors-boss.html#reorder-factors) has some helpful examples.

  2. Another variable. 
  
  - For example, if we wanted to bring back our example of ordering `gapminder` countries by life expectancy, we can visualize the results using `fct_reorder()`. 


```r
##  default summarizing function is median()
gapminder %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Continent") + ylab("Number of entries") 
```

```
## Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): object 'FILL_IN_THIS' not found
```

![](05112019-Factors_cm012_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

Use `fct_reorder2()` when you have a line chart of a quantitative x against another quantitative y and your factor provides the color. 


```r
## order by life expectancy 
ggplot(h_gap, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                  color = FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(color = "country")
```

```
## Error in ggplot(h_gap, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = FILL_IN_THIS)): object 'h_gap' not found
```

## Change order of the levels manually

This might be useful if you are preparing a report for say, the state of affairs in Africa.


```r
gapminder %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(FILL_IN_THIS)) +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw() 
```

```
## Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...): object 'FILL_IN_THIS' not found
```

![](05112019-Factors_cm012_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->
More details on reordering factor levels by hand can be found [here] https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/fct_relevel.html

### Recoding factors

Sometimes you want to specify what the levels of a factor should be.
For instance, if you had levels called "blk" and "brwn", you would rather they be called "Black" and "Brown" - this is called recoding.
Lets recode `Oceania` and the `Americas` in the graph above as abbreviations `OCN` and `AME` respectively using the function `fct_recode()`.



## Grow a factor (OPTIONAL)

Letâ€™s create two data frames,`df1` and `df2` each with data from two countries, dropping unused factor levels.


The country factors in df1 and df2 have different levels.
Can we just combine them?


The country factors in `df1` and `df2` have different levels.
Can you just combine them using `c()`?


Explore how different forms of row binding work behave here, in terms of the country variable in the result.
